        <h3 class="faq-title">Why Shouldn't we trust Birds?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          The Birds Aren't Real movement exists to spread awareness that the
          U.S. Government genocided over 12 Billion birds from 1959-2001, and
          replaced these birds with surveillance drone replicas, which still
          watch us every day. Once a preventative cause, our initial goal was to
          stop the forced extinction of real birds. Unfortunately this was
          unsuccessful, and the government has since replaced every living bird
          with robotic replicas. Now our movement's prerogative is to make
          everyone aware of this fact.

        <h3 class="faq-title">WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'BIRDS AREN’T REAL'?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          The term “Birds Aren’t Real” refers to biological “Birds” no longer
          existing on United States soil. After the government forcibly made the
          entire species extinct in the 20th century, all of these real birds
          were replaced with surveillance drones designed to look just like
          Birds. To simplify- Birds no longer exist in the U.S. as a biological
          lifeform, thus, Birds Aren’t Real!

        <h3 class="faq-title">WHAT ARE EGGS?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          The “eggs” we see in the 21st century are specifically designed by the
          government to appear indistinguishable from what eggs once were, when
          birds were real. When the government replaced the species with robotic
          replicas, it was key that these replicas sustained the same activities
          that their biological predecessors did, including producing edible
          eggs.

      <div class="faq">
        <h3 class="faq-title">HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN BIRD MEAT?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          All “Meat” found in “Birds” today is 100% synthetic. If birds suddenly
          became inedible, the government’s entire scheme would have been
          compromised. In order for their transition from “Real Bird to Drone
          Replica” to make sense, they had to imitate all parts of real birds in
          their robot copies. This includes tasty, edible meat- just synthetic.
          Synthetic meat is actually very accessible in modern times, with many
          fast food operations openly using it in their meals. The government
          simply had access to these modern technologies decades before the
          public.

        <h3 class="faq-title">I HAVE A PET BIRD, WHAT DO I DO ?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Not to startle you, but you have a highly advanced governmental
          surveillance drone in your house, watching your every movement,
          picking up every word of your conversations, and sending that data
          into to the pentagon. “Pet Birds” were actually unheard of before
          2001, when all Birds became surveillance drones. At this time, the
          government started a propaganda campaign normalizing “Pet Birds” (if
          you think about it, a Pet Bird in a cage doesn’t even make sense- the
          animals are supposed to have endless sky to explore, not to be held
          within a cage in a house). You would be best advised to not bring up
          any matters you’d prefer to remain confidential around your “Pet Bird”
